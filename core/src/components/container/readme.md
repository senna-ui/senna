The grid is a powerful mobile-first flexbox system for building custom layouts.

It is composed of three units — a grid, row(s) and column(s). Columns will expand to fill the row, and will resize to fit additional columns. It is based on a 12 column layout with different breakpoints based on the screen size. The number of columns can be customized using CSS
