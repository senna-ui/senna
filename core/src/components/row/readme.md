# sen-row

Rows are horizontal components of the [grid](../grid) system and contain varying numbers of
[columns](../col). They ensure the columns are positioned properly.

See [Grid Layout](/docs/layout/grid) for more information.


## Row Alignment

By default, columns will stretch to fill the entire height of the row and wrap when necessary. Rows are [flex containers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Container), so there are several [CSS classes](/docs/layout/css-utilities#flex-container-properties) that can be applied to a row to customize this behavior.
